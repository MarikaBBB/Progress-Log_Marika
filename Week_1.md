## Guidance
Answer the following questions considering the [learning outcomes for this week](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/server/learning-outcomes/).
Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of a learning outcome you have achieved this week.
 ### Conditionally set ports for our server based on the runtime environment  

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`));
```

 ### 2. Show an example of a learning outcome you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
 ### Read files synchronously and asynchronously using Nodeâ€™s fs module 

 We didn't use the fs module in this project, so it would be good to revisit this and use it in a future project.
