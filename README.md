# progress-log

Throughout your time on the 12 week training block, all apprentices are required to keep a progress log. The purpose of the progress log is to enable apprentices to reflect on their learning, identify strengths and areas for development, and to receive feedback on their progress from the Course Facilitators in order to improve. This progress log must be completed every Friday as a reflection activity on the previous week's learning outcomes.
